1,Other,I optimize between performance and cost. ,Current utilization;Upload speed;Download speed;Number of devices connected,,Only when not working,No,Second Network,Higher network utilization,Second Network,The frequency of blinking might correspond to the volume of data sent over then network. 
2,My router was chosen for me,NA,Upload speed;Download speed;Number of devices connected,NA,Only when not working,Yes,Second Network,Higher network utilization,Second Network,The blinks seem to indicate a higher workload
3,Performance,NA,Current utilization;Upload speed;Download speed;Number of devices connected,NA,Weekly,Yes,Second Network,Higher network utilization,Second Network,More blinking
4,Performance,NA,Upload speed;Download speed;Number of devices connected,,Only when not working,Yes,Second Network,Higher network utilization,Second Network,Yes
5,Performance,I sometimes consider privacy as a factor. I try as hard as I can to mitigate tracking (though sometimes it seems futile),Current utilization;Upload speed;Download speed;Number of devices connected,,Only when not working,No,First Network,Higher network utilization,First Network,I'm assuming that the first network is blinking more frequently. I'm also assuming that it corresponds to more traffic.
6,Performance,N/A,Current utilization;Upload speed;Download speed;Number of devices connected,,Only when not working,Yes,Second Network,Higher network utilization,Second Network,Frequency of blinks is higher thus more traffic
7,My router was chosen for me,"If my router hadn't be selected for me, I would have looked at product reviews to make my choice",Download speed;Number of devices connected;Other,Whether you can configure VPN,Only when not working,Yes,Second Network,Higher network utilization,Second Network,Because it is blinking more
8,My router was chosen for me,N/A,Current utilization;Upload speed;Download speed,,Only when not working,No,Second Network,Higher network utilization,Second Network,Because the router is blinking more
9,Performance,n/a,Current utilization;Upload speed;Download speed,,Only when not working,No,Second Network,Higher network utilization,Second Network,blinking frequency
10,Performance,N/A,Current utilization;Upload speed;Download speed;Number of devices connected,N/A,Never,Yes,First Network,Higher network utilization,First Network,Blinking more frequently
11,Performance,n/a,Current utilization;Upload speed;Download speed;Number of devices connected;Other,Security settings,Only when not working,Yes,Second Network,Higher network utilization,Second Network,I look at a binary status indicator like a light as an indication of data being sent through- flashing indicates more packets being processed while solid light on indicates the network is active and solid light off indicates it is inactive. 
12,Performance,internet speed,Current utilization;Upload speed;Download speed,,Only when not working,Yes,Second Network,Higher network utilization,First Network,It seems more steady?? 
13,Performance,NA,Current utilization;Upload speed;Download speed;Number of devices connected,,Never,Yes,First Network,Higher network utilization,First Network, 
14,Design,I wanted a mesh router,Current utilization;Upload speed;Download speed;Number of devices connected;Other,"connection strength. a lot of these are included in the google wifi management app, but not visible from the router",Only when not working,Yes,Second Network,Higher network utilization,Second Network,"I would assume it's sending more packets, but unsure"
15,My router was chosen for me,N/A,Current utilization;Upload speed;Download speed;Number of devices connected,,Only when not working,Yes,Second Network,Higher network utilization,Second Network,Guessing
16,Cost,n/a,Current utilization;Upload speed;Download speed,,Never,Yes,First Network,Higher network utilization,First Network,because its blinking more.
17,Performance,n/a,Upload speed;Download speed,,Only when not working,Yes,Second Network,Higher network utilization,Second Network,more blinking
18,Performance,NA,Upload speed;Download speed,NA,Monthly,Yes,First Network,Higher network utilization,First Network,NA
19,Performance,Na,Current utilization;Upload speed;Download speed;Number of devices connected,,Only when not working,Yes,Second Network,Higher network utilization,Second Network,More blinks 
20,Performance,NA,Current utilization;Upload speed;Download speed;Number of devices connected,,Only when not working,No,Second Network,Higher network utilization,Second Network,faster blinks
21,Other,Parents' house :D,Current utilization;Upload speed;Download speed;Number of devices connected,,Only when not working,Yes,Second Network,Higher network utilization,Second Network,lights providing some sort of feedback or signal that it's being worked
22,Cost,NA,Upload speed;Download speed,,Monthly,Yes,First Network,Higher network utilization,First Network,Blinking fast
23,Performance,n/a,Current utilization,,Monthly,No,Second Network,Higher network utilization,Second Network,blink
24,Cost,n/a,Upload speed;Download speed;Number of devices connected,,Only when not working,Yes,Second Network,Higher network utilization,Second Network,there are more blinks so there's prob more traffic
25,My router was chosen for me,N/A,Current utilization;Upload speed;Download speed;Number of devices connected,,Only when not working,Yes,Second Network,Higher network utilization,Second Network,Faster blinking
