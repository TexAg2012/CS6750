The models we are considering include neural networks, na√Øve bayes, K-nearest neighbor, and decision tree. Each of these models has strengths and limitations that will need to be analyzed on real data. Neural networks have been used extensively in image and speech recognition with great success. This model trains a system of synthetic neurons to group patterns into hidden layers. Bayesian models are meant to model uncertainty in each data set. By utilizing past probabilities, we can estimate current probabilities. K-nearest neighbor compares a data point to nearby values along multiple axis. Based on the category of each we can estimate the probability of the point in question belonging to the same category as its neighbors. This method is particularly effective in data without clear delineation and multiple clusters. Decision tree models split data along a variable to group the most similar data points together. Data continues to split until it reaches either saturation of a certain category or the minimum number of data points. Like KNN the final prediction is based on the ratio of each category in the final grouping.
